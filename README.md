# calories_burnt_prediction
Developed an interactive web application using Flask to 
predict calories burnt based on user inputs like gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate and      
temperature. Trained an XGBoost regression model after preprocessing and combining datasets for exercise 
and calorie tracking. Designed a HTML interface with CSS for user-friendly data entry and real-time display. 
Integrated the trained model with Flask using joblib for seamless prediction.
